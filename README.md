# BankSystem
This is the project of client and server sides that emulate some functions of banking system.

The repo contains at least 5k lines of Java code

# Motivation
The main point is about to follow the preferences of @yegor256 in his course "Challenges of Object Oriented Programming". The whole concepts is described by the statement: "Expose only behavior and hide data". In particular:
- No getters and setters. Except the ones from the libraries used (JDBC and Google Lantena)
- No inheritance
- No public static field and methods. No utilty classes
- No null is operated
- Only immutable classes. All variables are private final
